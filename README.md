# Polynomial
Polynomial educational project
The application allows you to add poins to the panel by left mouse click and remove points from the panel by right mouse click, which will be used to construct and reconstruct the Newton polynomial and its derivative.
There are also possibilities: hide the display of points, polynomial and derivative; change the color of points, polynomial and derivative.
It is also possible to change the scale of the coordinate system.
